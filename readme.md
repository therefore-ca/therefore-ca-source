# therefore.ca source
This repository is the main source code for the therefore.ca website. The project distributable exists as a seperate repository, but changes here will eventually make it into the dist upstream for release.

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo
2. Run ```npm run init```. This will install the needed npm & bower packages, as well as the Grunt CLI to ensure you can work with the site.
3. To run and work locally, run ```npm run serve```
4. You will be able to open a browser to http://localhost:8888, with Live Reload and you're good to go.
