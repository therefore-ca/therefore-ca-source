          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p class="lead">Unifor is the result of an ambitious merger between the Canadian Auto Workers union (CAW) and the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada (CEP).</p>
          <p>As Canada’s largest private sector union with more than 310,000 members in every major sector of the economy, Unifor is committed to creating a strong and effective union – making positive change in communities and workplaces across the country.</p>
          <p>We worked with Unifor to build a rich, interactive national digital presence that engages the membership and positions Unifor to meet the communication demands of a modern society. From the ground up, we helped Unifor build a brand new web platform to address the needs of over 310,000 members of what is now Canada’s largest private sector union.</p>

          <p>As Unifor continues to grow and scale, we continue to support them and their many initiatives through the refinement of their digital ecosystem and the development of new tools to keep them deeply connected.</p>

        <h2>Think nationally, act locally</h2>
        <p>Unifor consists of many small local chapters. While the National and Quebec offices focus on activities that affect the union as a whole, local chapters also wanted tools so they could better communicate with members. We developed an easy-to-use microsite platform that allows local chapters to get up and running without having to know anything about building a website.</p>
        <p>The big challenge was delivering six design options and back-end authoring tools that supported both English and French. Plus a setup "wizard" to make it very simple for non-technical users to create a beautiful and branded web presence.</p>

        <h2>Unions don't discriminate, so their website can't either</h2>
        <p>Through structured brainstorming sessions with Therefore, Unifor realized that an effective digital communication platform must work across every device and screen size. Equally important, it needed to be fully accessible to members with disabilities.</p>
        <p>Our mandate was clear: we needed to leverage responsive web design to ensure the site worked on everything from smartphones all the way up to desktop PCs. Plus we had to meet the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/" target="_blank">W3C's WCAG 2.0 Level AA guidelines</a> for web accessibility.</p>

        <h2>Connecting labour from coast to coast</h2>
        <p>Union membership spans every province and territory, but Unifor needed a single platform to service current and prospective members in both national languages. Union leadership also needed a set of tools to get their message out and keep members updated on initiatives and activities.</p>
        <p>
          The result is Unifor.org, a website infrastructure that serves as a:

                    In the initial phase, we released both the National and Unifor Quebec websites by the deadline.</p>
                  <p>Development was done using Agile and Drupal CMS. Building upon the framework established, a local union website factory was also developed. Agile methodology was used to deliver prioritized and shippable software within strict, time-boxed increments.</p>
                  <p>Following the initial launch, we operated a continuous release program that allowed us to deploy the remaining features as tightly-packaged updates every two weeks over the following months. This gave us the time we needed to build both the more complex features Unifor required and the local union website factory.</p>

              <h4>Creating a new standard for labour unions in Canada</h4>
              <p>Early in the process it was decided that the legacy constraints of the CEP or CAW digital infrastructures would not be limiters for what Unifor can be. Unifor needed to be a modern union and set the standard for what a labour union can be in Canada. Our main accomplishment working with Unifor was the building of a framework that standardized not only content workflows and the Unifor data model, but also the way in which users interact with the content through the many websites.</p>

              <h4>Activism Needs Modern Communication Systems</h4>
              <p>Since working with Unifor, we have worked with a number of other organizations that participate in vigorous campaigning for political and social change using web technologies. It’s important that these organizations use the same communication tools that the people they are trying to reach are using. The message unions are sending is important to both educate people and inform people when there is a need for change. We feel privileged to play our part.</p>

              <h4>Pushing the needle forward</h4>
              <p>As Unifor continues to grow and scale, we continue to support them and their many initiatives through the refinement of their digital ecosystem and the development of new tools to keep them deeply connected.</p>
